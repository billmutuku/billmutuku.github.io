        <h2>My Short Story & Journey</h2>
        <p id="story-text">How did I end up in tech? Well, I can confidently say that no matter how many times I deviated, the path always led me back. Here’s my story.

My first significant interaction with a computer was in high school, as a computer studies student. Sounds great, right? Well, it didn’t last long as I soon found myself 
in serious trouble. Why? Because instead of revising for CAT exams, I was busy racing through Need for Speed: Most Wanted(Favorite game back then). But that was not the 
actual problem. The real issue was my terrible tab-switching reflexes.I wish I had known the function of Alt + Tab back then. Too bad I couldn't save myself and now there 
was my computer teacher, already standing behind me. Busted.As a result, I was given lab cleaning duty as punishment. Innocently, I asked if there was an alternative 
sentence, and that’s how I ended up in a Business Studies class. Why did I pick switching subjects over cleaning the labs? To this day, I still have no idea. But atleast,
I got the opportunity to focus on Physics, which became my favorite subject and later on my gateway to Computer Science.Fast forward to university, I decided to rekindle
 my long-lost love for tech. Like every other computer scientist who has ever existed (except maybe Charles Babbage and Alan Turing), my first program was the usual print("Hello, World!"). And that little moment of magic changed everything. From then on, I was hooked. My journey in tech, AI, and data science officially began. It has 
been nothing short of exhilarating, and I’ve never looked back.So, join me on this adventure. And don’t worry, I won’t make you clean any labs!😆</p>
